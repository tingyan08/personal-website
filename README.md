## What is this?

This [personal website](https://tingyan08.github.io/personal-website/) is designed and modified based on the template provided by [Yuji Sato](https://yujisatojr.github.io/react-portfolio-template/).

## Quick Setup

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Check your installation by running:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

2. In the project directory, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

5. Customize the template by navigating to the `/src/components` directory. Modify texts, pictures, and other information as needed.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.


## Deployment

1. **Set Up GitHub Repository**

    Create a new repository on GitHub for your portfolio app.

2. **Configure `package.json`**

            "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your GitHub repository.
